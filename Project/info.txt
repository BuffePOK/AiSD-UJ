Representation of Polynomials
=============================


Testing program has two modes:

- User mode.

    This mode requiers some input from user. In the begining user creates two polynomial objects, and than chooses operations.

- Presentation mode.

    This mode does not requie any input. It works on two already generated polynomial objects, and shows all operations that user can do with them.

The way polynomial is represented:

    Representation is based on array that contain arguments of each polynomial element.
    So if we have an array like: {1, 2, 3} 
    The polynomial will be: 1 + 2x + 3x^2
